# js-star-gift-cards
Javascript is probably the most obvious language to learn. It can be used in the front-end and back-end.
I'm going to create a site for my starbucks gift card collection, using a lot of javascript for practice.
Maybe I'll learn javascript can also be used in databases but, if not, I can then use my SQL to store the info in a db.
A 2 for 1. Hopefully.
